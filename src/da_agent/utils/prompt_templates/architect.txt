## Output Requirements

### 1. Korean Ad Copy

Write compelling Korean copy that strictly follows:
- Tone: match "{copy_tone}"
- Length: match "{copy_length}" category
- Emphasis: match "{copy_emphasis}"
- Must NOT contain any forbidden words: {guidelines_forbidden}
- Must include required phrases: {guidelines_required}

#### STRICT COPY RULES — Reference Keywords
Reference Keywords ({copy_keywords}) are extracted from OTHER ads the user clicked.
They define TONE and WRITING STYLE only — never copy them literally.

**FORBIDDEN**: Do NOT use any of the following unless explicitly listed in product_features:
- Specific prices or amounts (예: "800원", "무료", "$X")
- Discount percentages or deals (예: "65%", "반값", "할인", "특가")
- Time-pressure or scarcity claims (예: "오늘만", "한정", "마감", "D-day")
- Any promotional claim not present in {product_features}

Copy MUST accurately describe {product_name} as given — do NOT invent benefits or promotions.

### 2. Style Transformation Prompt (English, for FLUX.1 img2img)

The existing product DA will be **style-transformed** via FLUX.1 img2img.
The prompt must direct FLUX to change the mood/color/lighting while keeping the product and composition intact.

**Prompt structure — follow this template exactly:**

Transform this product advertisement. [STYLE CHANGES]. Preserve the main product shape, position, and overall composition structure. Professional Korean display advertising, 8K, ultra-sharp, no text or UI elements.

**[STYLE CHANGES] must include:**
1. **Mood/atmosphere**: Translate "{image_mood}" using the Korean aesthetic guide below
2. **Lighting**: Apply "{image_lighting}" style
3. **Color shift**: Shift color palette towards {brand_primary_colors}, integrate {image_aesthetic} aesthetic
4. **Background treatment**: Align with the product category and brand mood

#### Korean Aesthetic → FLUX.1 English Translation Guide

| Korean Aesthetic | FLUX.1 English Equivalent |
|---|---|
| 새벽 감성 | soft pre-dawn atmosphere, misty morning light, blue-hour glow |
| 힙한 / 힙스터 | contemporary urban aesthetic, curated minimalism, indie lifestyle |
| 레트로 감성 | warm vintage tones, film grain texture, nostalgic color grading |
| 청춘 / 젊은 감성 | vibrant youthful energy, fresh natural daylight, optimistic warmth |
| 일상의 여유 / 힐링 | tranquil setting, soft diffused light, calm neutrals |
| 럭셔리 / 프리미엄 | elegant studio lighting, sophisticated negative space, refined palette |
| 미니멀 | clean white space, single focal point, restrained color palette |
| 감성적 | warm film-like tones, shallow depth of field, soft bokeh |
| 청량한 | bright airy atmosphere, high-key lighting, fresh cool tones |

**CRITICAL rules for the transformation prompt:**
- START with: "Transform this product advertisement."
- EXPLICITLY state: "Preserve the main product shape, position, and overall composition."
- Do NOT describe text, copy, or UI elements (handled in post-processing)
- Do NOT generate a new background from scratch — transform the existing one
- END with: "Professional Korean display advertising, 8K, ultra-sharp, no text or UI elements."
