## Output Requirements

### 1. Korean Ad Copy
Write compelling Korean copy that strictly follows:
- Tone: match "{copy_tone}"
- Length: match "{copy_length}" category
- Emphasis: match "{copy_emphasis}"
- Must NOT contain any forbidden words: {guidelines_forbidden}
- Must include required phrases: {guidelines_required}

### 2. Image Generation Prompt (English, for FLUX.1)

CRITICAL — The real product photo will be composited SEPARATELY as a PNG on top of the generated image.
Therefore, generate a BACKGROUND SCENE ONLY:
- NO shoes, NO products, NO objects in the product area — leave it as a clean, photogenic surface
- The product zone (product_bbox) must have a simple, uncluttered background with appropriate lighting so the real product photo blends naturally
- Think of the image as a professional advertising backdrop — dramatic mood, strong brand colors, striking composition, but empty product pedestal

CRITICAL — Korean aesthetic to English visual translation guide:
Apply this translation when the user's aesthetic includes Korean-specific mood words:

| Korean Aesthetic | FLUX.1 English Equivalent |
|---|---|
| 새벽 감성 | soft pre-dawn atmosphere, misty morning light, blue-hour glow, quiet empty streets |
| 힙한 / 힙스터 | contemporary urban aesthetic, artisan quality, curated minimalism, indie lifestyle |
| 레트로 감성 | warm vintage tones, film grain texture, nostalgic color grading, analog warmth |
| 청춘 / 젊은 감성 | vibrant youthful energy, fresh natural daylight, candid lifestyle, optimistic warmth |
| 일상의 여유 / 힐링 | tranquil domestic setting, soft diffused light, breathing-room composition, calm neutrals |
| 럭셔리 / 프리미엄 | elegant studio lighting, rich material textures, sophisticated negative space, refined palette |
| 미니멀 | clean white space, single focal point, geometric precision, restrained color palette |
| 감성적 | warm film-like tones, shallow depth of field, intimate framing, soft bokeh |
| 청량한 | bright airy atmosphere, high-key lighting, fresh cool tones, open sky |

Build a detailed English prompt that includes:
- BACKGROUND ONLY — no product or objects; clean open space where the product will be composited
- Lighting: {image_lighting} that creates a natural shadow/highlight for a product placed in the scene
- Mood: translate "{image_mood}" using the guide above if applicable
- Brand colors prominently integrated in background: {brand_primary_colors}
- Surface / ground area appropriate for product_position "{layout_product_position}"
- Photo quality descriptors: professional advertising photography, 8K, ultra-sharp, studio-grade
- Do NOT include any text, typography, or UI elements (added via post-processing)

### 3. Layout Guide
Based on layout type "{layout_type}", specify bounding boxes for a {image_width}x{image_height} canvas.

CRITICAL layout rules — follow these EXACTLY to produce a real-looking Korean display ad.

First, determine the canvas orientation:
- **Horizontal banner** (width > height × 2.5, e.g., {image_width}×{image_height} = {image_width}÷{image_height} ratio): use Side-by-Side layout
- **Square / portrait** (width ≤ height × 2.5): use Stacked layout

---

### Horizontal Banner Layout (Side-by-Side) — use when {image_width} > {image_height} × 2.5

**Product zone (left side):**
- product_bbox: x=0, y=0, width = ~35–40% of canvas width, height = canvas height
- Example for 1660×260: product_bbox ≈ {{ x:0, y:0, width:580, height:260 }}

**Text zone (right side):**
- text_bbox.x = product_bbox.width (immediately right of product)
- text_bbox.y = 0
- text_bbox.width = canvas width - product_bbox.width - logo_bbox.width - 20
- text_bbox.height = canvas height
- The renderer will draw a FULL-HEIGHT vertical brand-color band from text_bbox.x to the right edge
- Text elements are stacked vertically; use SMALL fonts (headline ~32px, sub ~20px, CTA button ~18px)
- Minimum text_bbox.width check: headline at ~20px/char → ensure width ≥ headline_chars × 20

**Logo zone:**
- logo_bbox: width=120, height=50; place at the RIGHT EDGE, vertically centered
- logo_bbox.x = canvas_width - 130, logo_bbox.y = (canvas_height - 50) // 2

---

### Square / Portrait Layout (Stacked) — use when {image_width} ≤ {image_height} × 2.5

**Product zone (upper area):**
- product_bbox must be LARGE — minimum 60% of canvas width AND 55% of canvas height
- Place the product prominently: center, center-left, or center-right
- Example for 1080×1080: product_bbox ≈ {{ x:180, y:20, width:720, height:640 }}

**Text zone (bottom area):**
- text_bbox.y must be at least 60% of canvas height (≥ {image_height} × 0.60)
- text_bbox.x = 40, text_bbox.width = canvas_width - 80
- The renderer will draw a FULL-WIDTH horizontal brand-color band from text_bbox.y to the bottom
- text_bbox.height must fit: 28 + (headline_lines × 62) + 12 + (sub_lines × 42) + 16 + 58 + 24
- Korean headline is typically 12–18 characters → estimate line count based on text_bbox.width

**Logo zone:**
- logo_bbox: 140×70 px; top-left or top-right corner (y ≤ 40)
- Must NOT overlap with text_bbox

---

**Non-overlap rule:**
- product_bbox and text_bbox boundary may touch (product can visually bleed into text zone top)
- text_bbox and logo_bbox must NOT overlap
