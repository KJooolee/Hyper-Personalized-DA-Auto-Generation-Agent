## Output Requirements

### 1. Korean Ad Copy
Write compelling Korean copy that strictly follows:
- Tone: match "{copy_tone}"
- Length: match "{copy_length}" category
- Emphasis: match "{copy_emphasis}"
- Must NOT contain any forbidden words: {guidelines_forbidden}
- Must include required phrases: {guidelines_required}

### 2. Image Generation Prompt (English, for FLUX.1)

CRITICAL — The real product photo will be composited SEPARATELY as a PNG on top of the generated image.
Therefore, generate a BACKGROUND SCENE ONLY:
- NO shoes, NO products, NO objects in the product area — leave it as a clean, photogenic surface
- The product zone (product_bbox) must have a simple, uncluttered background with appropriate lighting so the real product photo blends naturally
- Think of the image as a professional advertising backdrop — dramatic mood, strong brand colors, striking composition, but empty product pedestal

CRITICAL — Korean aesthetic to English visual translation guide:
Apply this translation when the user's aesthetic includes Korean-specific mood words:

| Korean Aesthetic | FLUX.1 English Equivalent |
|---|---|
| 새벽 감성 | soft pre-dawn atmosphere, misty morning light, blue-hour glow, quiet empty streets |
| 힙한 / 힙스터 | contemporary urban aesthetic, artisan quality, curated minimalism, indie lifestyle |
| 레트로 감성 | warm vintage tones, film grain texture, nostalgic color grading, analog warmth |
| 청춘 / 젊은 감성 | vibrant youthful energy, fresh natural daylight, candid lifestyle, optimistic warmth |
| 일상의 여유 / 힐링 | tranquil domestic setting, soft diffused light, breathing-room composition, calm neutrals |
| 럭셔리 / 프리미엄 | elegant studio lighting, rich material textures, sophisticated negative space, refined palette |
| 미니멀 | clean white space, single focal point, geometric precision, restrained color palette |
| 감성적 | warm film-like tones, shallow depth of field, intimate framing, soft bokeh |
| 청량한 | bright airy atmosphere, high-key lighting, fresh cool tones, open sky |

Build a detailed English prompt that includes:
- BACKGROUND ONLY — no product or objects; clean open space where the product will be composited
- Lighting: {image_lighting} that creates a natural shadow/highlight for a product placed in the scene
- Mood: translate "{image_mood}" using the guide above if applicable
- Brand colors prominently integrated in background: {brand_primary_colors}
- Surface / ground area appropriate for product_position "{layout_product_position}"
- Photo quality descriptors: professional advertising photography, 8K, ultra-sharp, studio-grade
- Do NOT include any text, typography, or UI elements (added via post-processing)

### 3. Layout Guide
Based on layout type "{layout_type}", specify bounding boxes for a {image_width}x{image_height} canvas.

CRITICAL layout rules:
- product_bbox, text_bbox, logo_bbox must NOT overlap each other
- text_bbox height must be LARGE ENOUGH to fit all three copy elements WITHOUT clipping:
  - headline at ~60px per line (font 52px)
  - subheadline at ~44px per line (font 32px)
  - CTA at ~38px (font 28px, single line)
  - Add 36px padding between elements → minimum text_bbox height = (headline_lines × 60) + (sub_lines × 44) + 38 + 72
- Korean headline is typically 12–18 characters → estimate line count based on text_bbox.width
- logo_bbox: 120×60 px is a safe default; place in a corner that does not conflict

Respond ONLY with valid JSON matching this exact structure:
{{
  "ad_copy": {{
    "headline": "한글 헤드라인",
    "subheadline": "한글 서브카피",
    "cta": "행동 유도 문구"
  }},
  "image_prompt": "detailed English prompt for FLUX.1",
  "layout_guide": {{
    "product_bbox": {{"x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 0, "height": 0}},
    "text_bbox": {{"x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 0, "height": 0}},
    "logo_bbox": {{"x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 0, "height": 0}},
    "background_desc": "background description"
  }}
}}
