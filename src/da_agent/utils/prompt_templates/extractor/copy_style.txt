### STRICT KEYWORD RULES

Keywords must capture ONLY the abstract writing STYLE and emotional TONE.
They will be applied to a completely different product — never use product-specific terms.

FORBIDDEN in keywords — NEVER include:
- Specific prices or amounts (e.g., "800원", "1,000원", "무료", "$10")
- Discount percentages or ratios (e.g., "65%", "50% OFF", "반값")
- Promotional/time-pressure terms (e.g., "오늘만", "한정", "특가", "이벤트", "D-day", "마감")
- Brand names or product names visible in the ad
- Any numeric value that relates to pricing or promotions

ALLOWED in keywords — ONLY include:
- Emotional tone words (e.g., "도전", "자연스러운", "편안함", "활력", "설렘")
- Narrative/call-to-action style patterns (e.g., "지금 시작", "새롭게", "경험하다")
- Abstract value propositions (e.g., "프리미엄", "일상의 변화", "나만의 선택")
- Sensory or mood descriptors (e.g., "청량한", "따뜻한", "역동적인")

If no suitable abstract keywords can be extracted, return an empty array [].

If text is partially obscured or unclear, infer from what is visible.
If no text is visible, return empty strings and empty arrays.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON matching this exact structure:

  "tone": "Korean advertising tone description",
  "length": "ultra-short|short|medium|long",
  "emphasis_type": "primary emphasis approach",
  "keywords": ["abstract_style_keyword1", "abstract_style_keyword2"]
